## How to Quickly Fake Powershell If You Know C#  
*Philly Code Camp, Sat Apr 13, 2019, 3pm*
**POWERSHELL** is a scripting language used to automate sysadmin tasks based on C#'s CLR library.  The code for this presentation is at http://github.com/brianwoelfel/PhillyDotNetApr2019
### Intended Audience
 * C# developers who vaguely know what Powershell is but are **too lazy to study it**
### Class Style 
 * No real-time hands-on coding assignments, but pull source code from git if you like while we talk
 * If you peek ahead don't blurt out answers to class questions!
### Objective
 * In what situations does it benefit you to pretend know Powershell?
 * Intro to basic syntax and advanced abbreviated syntax
 * Top mistakes and misunderstandings C# folk have when doing Powershell
 * How to do SQL calls
 * We're NOT going to do advanced sysadmin stuff
