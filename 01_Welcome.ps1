Philly Code Camp, Sat Apr 13, 2019, 3pm

Powershell is a scripting language used to automate sysadmin tasks based on C#'s CLR library.

Intended Audience: C# developers who vaguely know what Powershell is but too lazy to study it

Class Style: 
 * No real-time hands-on coding assignments, but pull source code from git if you like while we talk
 * If you peek ahead don't blurt out answers to class questions!

Objective:
 * In what situations does it benefit you to pretend know Powershell?
 * Fast intro to powershell syntax
 * Top mistakes and misunderstandings C# folk have when doing Powershell
 * Intro to abbreviated syntax used by powershell pros
 * How to call nuget packages
 * How to do SQL calls
 * We're not going to do advanced sysadmin stuff
