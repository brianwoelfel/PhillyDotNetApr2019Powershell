Thanks for joining!  

Final thoughts:
* You should recognize powershell shorthand like ? { }, % { }, gci, sc, 
  but be nice to your future replacements and use the long form when writing code 
* A real devops or sysadmin will appreciate you using proper function naming syntax,
  proper commenting with examples, and unit tests.
