Thanks for joining!  

Final thoughts:
* You should recognize powershell shorthand like ? { }, % { }, gci, sc, 
  but be nice to your future replacements and use the long form when writing code 
* A real devops or sysadmin will appreciate you using proper function naming syntax,
  proper commenting with examples, and unit tests.
* Unlike real programming languages, you really can fake Powershell in a few days

If you're working in Philly reach out to me and let's have lunch!
I've got lots of opinions on DotNet Core, Angular, Jenkins, GitHub, Kubernetes, Docker, MongoDB, and AWS
including "I don't understand what's going on" and "How does this work?""
